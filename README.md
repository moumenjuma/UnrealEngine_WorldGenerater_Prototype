# WorldGenerater_Prototype
This is a one biome World Generator, that will loops all the way around to simulate a spherical planet  

# Explanation
the world will generate around the player with a certian algorithm, 
it will generate a ring of terrain with high resolution closer to the player, 
and lower the resolution in the next set rings that are further away from 
the player then it will loop this algorithm until the world the player sees is endless. 
THIS PROJECT HAS NO WORLD FALL OFF POINT OR INVISIBLE WALLS!!

*Please note that this is still just a prototype / proof of concept*
